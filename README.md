## Complementary article

This is a sample app accompanying my Medium.com article [Build Your First Kotlin Multiplatform App: With Minimum KMP Knowledge - Achieve Maximum Efficiency with Minimal Effort](https://medium.com/@callmeryan/build-your-first-kotlin-multiplatform-app-with-minimum-kmp-knowledge-acc894dc270f). There you can learn how to set up a Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose Multiplatform) project from scratch, and build this app on Android, desktop, web and iOS.

<br />
<br />

## Some technical details

* `/composeApp` is for Kotlin code shared across the Compose Multiplatform application.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
    - `androidMain` is the traditional Android project root.
    - `desktopMain` is for the desktop (JVM) app.
    - `wasmJsMain` is for the web app.
    - `iosMain` is for the Kotlin code to be exposed to the iOS app.

* `/iosApp` contains the iOS application. Open `iosApp.xcodeproj` to build the App.
